# Phase 6: Evaluation

The evaluation pipeline ensures that all implemented work meets both mechanical requirements and the original intent. It enforces a strict separation between the author and the critic to prevent leniency.

## Finding Categories

Every critic finding (code critic, test critic) MUST include a `category` so the orchestrator can route fix work correctly instead of blindly retrying the source job:

| Category | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| `product_bug` | Implementation does not match spec intent | Retry the source dev job |
| `test_bug` | Tests assert wrong thing or would pass when they should fail | Retry with explicit test-strengthening requirements |
| `harness_bug` | Build/lint/test harness itself is broken | Retry or remediate with scope limited to build/CI/scripts |
| `evidence_mismatch` | Report numbers don't match fresh command output | Re-run the source job's verification commands, refresh report |
| `contention` | Failure looks like sibling eval stepping on shared state | Re-run after siblings complete, or switch to sequential mode |
| `scope_conflict` | Job edited files outside its declared scope (e.g. report-only job touched code, or a normal job edited `.tenet/project/**`) | Trigger the blocking finding escape hatch (see 05-execution-loop.md) |

The critic emits findings as objects: `{"category": "...", "detail": "..."}`. Orchestrators MUST read the category to pick the right response — plain retry loops waste cycles on bugs that aren't product bugs.

## E2E Surface And Verification Honesty

The interaction-e2e critic does agent-driven verification through whatever public surface the job exposes — browser UI, CLI, API, library, or none. It returns a `surface` field (what it classified) and a `layer2_status` field (whether browser/visual exploration applied), so downstream readers can tell what was actually exercised:

- `completed` — a browser surface was exercised interactively via Playwright MCP. Findings reflect real interactive use.
- `skipped_no_mcp` — browser/visual exploration was required-but-unavailable, and the harness/spec allowed skipping it. Only scripted results are reported.
- `not_applicable` — this surface is not a browser (cli, api, library, or none). This is honest and expected, **not** a gap: the critic still ran agent-brain e2e on that surface and reported the result in `exploratory_findings`.
- `failed` — browser Layer 2 or a required runtime was attempted but could not run (app wouldn't start, MCP errors).

`tenet_get_status` surfaces the latest completed `interaction_e2e` critic job's status as `latest_e2e_status` (the value comes from the critic's `layer2_status` field). For non-browser surfaces treat `not_applicable` as "browser Layer 2 didn't apply — read the non-browser e2e result," **not** as "unverified."

If the harness/spec requires browser/visual exploration, missing Playwright MCP is a failure. If it is optional or skipped with reason, `skipped_no_mcp` is acceptable. For CLI/API/library surfaces the critic uses the shell — it does not skip, and it does not force a browser.

## Parallel vs Sequential Critics

The configured critic jobs may run **in parallel** or **sequentially**, decided by the readiness gate verdict (`eval_parallel_safe:{feature}` in the config table). The critic set comes from `.tenet/critics.json` — 3 built-in by default (code critic, test critic, interaction-e2e), plus any project-defined custom critics (see `../critics.md`):

- **Parallel** (verdict `true`) — pure libraries, CLIs, data pipelines with no shared mutable state. Critics start concurrently; completion time ≈ slowest single critic.
- **Sequential** (verdict `false` or missing) — stateful web apps where critics would collide on shared state (DB rows, sessions, rate-limit counters, ports, Playwright lock dirs). Critics run in roster order (code → test → playwright by default). The caller receives every critic's job id up front in `jobs[]`; job-manager auto-dispatches each downstream critic when its predecessor completes.

`tenet_start_eval` reads the verdict automatically — no orchestrator code change needed. If the verdict is missing, Tenet defaults to sequential (safe fallback). Disabling a built-in or adding a custom critic in `.tenet/critics.json` changes which (and how many) critics run; the blocking-finding resume gate tracks the same configured set, so disabling a critic does not strand a blocked parent.

## The 5 Evaluation Stages

### Stage 1: Mechanical
Automated checks with no human judgment. Run these commands and verify exit codes:
- **Lint**: Run the project linter from harness config.
- **Build**: Execute the build command.
- **Type-check**: Verify types across the changed files.
- **Tests**: Run the full test suite (unit + acceptance tests if they exist).
**PASS**: All exit 0. **FAIL**: Any non-zero exit code.

### Stage 1.5: Smoke Check (MANDATORY for dev jobs)
After mechanical checks pass, verify the implementation actually works at runtime:

**For server/API features:**
1. Start the application server
2. Hit each relevant API endpoint with a basic request
3. Verify non-5xx responses (200, 201, 301, 404 are OK — 500 is a fail)
4. Stop the server

**For frontend features:**
1. Start the dev server
2. Navigate to each relevant page
3. Verify pages render without console errors or blank screens
4. If Playwright is available, run `npx playwright test` against acceptance tests

**For CLI/library features:**
1. Run the CLI with basic arguments
2. Verify exit code and output format

**PASS**: Server starts, endpoints respond, pages render. **FAIL**: Server won't start, endpoints return 500, pages are blank/error.

A smoke check failure is a Stage 1 failure — the job cannot pass eval.

### Stage 2: Property-based
If the harness or spec defines property tests, run them now. These properties must predate the implementation. Skip if no property tests exist.

### Stage 3: Code Critic (Independent Context)
A separate agent session with no prior implementation history performs this review. It receives the spec, scenarios, harness, and the diff, but never the author's reasoning or prior conversation.

The code critic checks:
- Does the implementation match the spec's intent?
- Are any anti-scenarios violated?
- Are there obvious gaps or missing edge cases?
- Did the job edit `.tenet/project/**` without authorization? Authorization = the job was dispatched with `allow_project_doctrine_edits: true` (context-bootstrap, or a doctrine-maintenance job — see `phases/05-execution-loop.md` → *Applying a proposal*), or a direct user request. If edits are unauthorized, fail with `category: "scope_conflict"`.

**Zero-findings rule**: If the critic finds nothing, it must re-analyze using an alternate attack vector like security, performance, or concurrency. Zero findings trigger a mandatory second pass.

Then performs structured self-questioning:
- **Edge cases**: Empty input? Max values? Unicode?
- **Error paths**: Dependency failures? Timeouts? Disk full?
- **Integration**: Does this break upstream or downstream components?
- **Security**: Input validation? Secret exposure? Injection?
- **Performance**: N+1 queries? Unbounded loops? Memory leaks?

### Stage 4: Test Critic (Independent Context)
A separate agent session reviews whether the tests are **sufficient to prove the features actually work**. It receives the spec, scenarios, and acceptance/integration test files — NOT the implementation code.

The test critic checks:
- For each scenario: is there a test that covers it?
- Does each test verify the **correct outcome**, not just absence of errors?
  - BAD: `expect(page).not.toHaveURL(/error/)` — passes even if login redirects back to login
  - GOOD: `expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/)` — fails if login doesn't actually work
- After login: does the test verify session persists across reload?
- After create: does the test verify the item appears in a list/view?
- After form submit: does the test verify redirect to the correct destination?
- Are there routes/pages/endpoints with NO test coverage at all?
- Are there interactive elements (buttons, forms) with no test?

If tests are insufficient, the test critic outputs specific tests that need to be added or strengthened. These become requirements for a retry or blocking-finding follow-up before the integration checkpoint can pass.

## Integration Test Evaluation

Integration test jobs (`integration_test` type) have a different eval flow:
1. The integration test agent runs acceptance tests and reports results
2. If ALL tests pass → job completes successfully
3. If ANY test fails → job fails with detailed failure report
4. On failure, report-only integration jobs report a blocking finding with `tenet_report_blocking_finding`
5. After linked follow-up children complete and pass eval, the integration test is retried

The orchestrator should parse the integration test output to identify specific failures and report a focused blocking finding rather than retrying the entire feature.

## Evaluation Result Format
Record results via `tenet_update_knowledge` with a descriptive title. Example: `title="eval project-scaffold mechanical-and-spec-compliance"`. The tool defaults to `type="journal"` and writes a dated markdown file in the run journal (`.tenet/runs/<run-slug>/journal/`); pass `type="knowledge"` only for durable facts worth promoting to `.tenet/knowledge/`.

## Overall: PASS / FAIL
```

## Handling Failures
- **Stage 1/1.5 Fail**: Retry the current implementation job with an enhanced prompt that includes the mechanical/runtime failure.
- **Stage 3 Fail (Code Critic)**: Run reflection to find the root cause, then retry via `tenet_retry_job` with the critic findings.
- **Stage 4 Fail (Test Critic)**: Retry via `tenet_retry_job` with explicit test-strengthening requirements from the critic.
- **Integration test Fail**: If the job is `report_only`, call `tenet_report_blocking_finding` with the observed finding, why it blocks the report, recommended follow-up, and likely target files. Otherwise retry the integration job with an enhanced prompt.
- **Retry policy**: Use `tenet_retry_job` while there is a concrete unresolved finding and the next attempt will use new evidence or a changed approach. Tenet defaults to unlimited retries; projects may configure a finite retry budget. If MCP reports a finite budget is exhausted, mark the job blocked. If failures stagnate, stop and report even when retries remain.

### Stage 5: Interaction E2E (Independent Job)

Dispatched as a separate `interaction_e2e` job by `tenet_start_eval` alongside code critic and test critic. "Playwright" is only the browser tool the critic uses for browser surfaces, not the critic's identity. The worker has independent context (no implementation code, no author reasoning): it receives only the exact run artifacts, project doctrine, scenarios, and the running public surface.

The worker **classifies the declared e2e surface** first (`web_ui`, `visual`, `cli`, `api`, `library`, or `none`), then applies **the same agent-brain, exploratory rigor to whichever surface it is** — it never skips a non-browser surface, and never forces a browser onto one.

#### Agent-brain QA (ALL surfaces)
Beyond the happy-path checks the author declared, the worker probes like a real, hostile user:
- Edge and invalid inputs — empty, huge, unicode, wrong type, missing required values, off-by-one boundaries.
- Error paths — confirm failures surface the right non-zero exit / error status / clear message, not a silent success or a crash.
- Undocumented surface area — flags/endpoints/arguments the scenarios omit but a real user would try (`--help`, `--version`, unknown subcommands, default no-arg behavior).
- Chained workflows — commands/calls run in sequence the way a user actually operates.
- Regression traps — anything a scripted test passes but a human would notice is wrong.

#### Browser surface (web_ui / visual / canvas)
The worker MUST do BOTH layers unless the harness/spec explicitly marks Layer 2 optional or skipped with reason.

**Layer 1 — Scripted Playwright Tests (regression)**
1. Locate existing Playwright test files (`tests/e2e/`, `e2e/`, `tests/playwright/`)
2. Ensure the application is running (start dev server or docker compose)
3. Run `npx playwright test` (or the project's test command)
4. Report pass/fail counts and any failing tests

**Layer 2 — Exploratory Agent-Driven Testing (Playwright MCP)**
The worker uses Playwright MCP tools to interact with the app like a real user:
- `browser_navigate(url)` — go to a page
- `browser_click(selector)` — click buttons/links
- `browser_type(text)` / `browser_fill_form(...)` — enter text and fill form fields
- `browser_snapshot()` — inspect the accessibility snapshot and visible text
- `browser_take_screenshot()` — capture state visually
- `browser_evaluate(...)` — inspect page state when visible output is insufficient

For each scenario in scope, the worker navigates, performs the user actions, takes screenshots, and verifies the EXPECTED OUTCOME (not just absence of errors) — then applies the agent-brain QA list above in the browser (click every button, try invalid inputs, test navigation, confirm every spec feature is reachable).

#### CLI surface
Run the public commands declared in scenarios and verify exit code, stdout/stderr, files, and side effects — then go beyond them: probe `--help`/`--version`/unknown flags/default behavior; feed invalid/empty/huge/unicode/wrong-type args and confirm a non-zero exit with accurate stderr (not a stack trace or silent success); chain commands across one session; exercise pipes/stdin/interactive prompts/signals; check disk/env/config side effects.

#### API surface
Run the acceptance/integration tests or HTTP checks declared in the harness — then probe beyond them: hit endpoints/parameters NOT in the scenarios; try wrong method, unauthenticated, malformed/empty body, boundary inputs; verify response body and status SEMANTICS, not just non-5xx (a create that 200s without persisting, a 404 that should be a 401); check auth boundaries and error envelopes.

#### Library surface
Exercise the public API exploratorially: boundary/invalid inputs, contract-vs-docs drift, error paths — not just the happy-path integration tests. Do not invent a CLI/browser surface if the package exposes only a programmatic API.

#### No e2e surface
If the harness/spec declares no public surface for this job (pure internal module), set `surface: "none"` and `layer2_status: "not_applicable"`, state the reason, and pass — unless the harness REQUIRED a surface that is missing, in which case FAIL.

**What this catches that scripted tests miss:**
- Browser: stats page implemented but not wired to navigation; login form that submits but doesn't redirect; copy button that doesn't copy; broken CSS/styling that doesn't affect assertions.
- CLI: a flag that silently no-ops; an invalid argument that exits 0; a command that mishandles unicode paths.
- API: an endpoint that 200s on malformed input; a delete that returns success without removing; a 404 where auth should have returned 401.
- Library: a public function that throws on documented valid input; a return shape that drifts from the docs.

**When Playwright MCP is not available (browser surface only):** If browser/visual Layer 2 is required, fail the eval. If the harness/spec says it is optional or skipped with reason, report "Playwright MCP not installed — exploratory browser testing skipped" and pass on Layer 1 results only. For CLI/API/library/none surfaces Playwright MCP is irrelevant — proceed with that branch.

**When a required runtime won't start:** Only surfaces that need a running app/server apply here (browser, API). FAIL the eval — it must run to be tested. CLI/library surfaces that need no server are unaffected.

**PASS**: Scripted/declared checks pass AND agent-brain probing finds no issues.
**FAIL**: Any declared check fails OR agent-brain probing finds a behavioral bug. Retry or report a blocking finding with evidence (screenshots for browser; command output / request-response for CLI/API).

## Anti-Skip Enforcement
Evaluation is mandatory. Every job must pass Stage 1 and 1.5. Full mode runs every enabled critic — Stage 3 (code critic), Stage 4 (test critic), Stage 5 (interaction e2e), plus any custom critics enabled in `.tenet/critics.json`. All critics run in separate agent sessions with no access to the author's reasoning. The author cannot evaluate their own work.
